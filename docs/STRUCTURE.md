# Structure of Envlang operations

This file documents how Envlang reads in input files, lexes and parses meaningful tokens, and finally executes the interpreted command structure to produce output.

**While Envlang is in alpha development, this file can be used to track progress on the interpreter.**

## CLI operation and reading in an Envlang script

Usage:

```
envlang [FILE_NAME]
```

- Status: COMPLETE âœ…

Passing a file to the CLI tool should call `crate::io::read_file()`.

Errors if:
- File name does not end in `.envl`
- Any other error situations defined in `std::io::ErrorKind`

## Segment Envlang script into Unicode grapheme segments

- Status: COMPLETE âœ…

The successful results from `crate::io::read_file()` should be passed to `crate::unicodesegmenters::segment_graphemes()`.

Returns a `Vec<String>`, where each `String` is a valid Unicode character segment.

Errors if:
- ???

## Lex Unicode grapheme segments into Tokens

- Status: COMPLETE âœ…

The successful results from `crate::unicodesegmenters::segment_graphemes()` should be passed to `crate::lexer::Lexer.tokenize()`.

Returns a `Vec<Token>`, where each `Token` is a lexed token.

Errors if:
- No errors at the moment; inappropriate Tokens are simply skipped

## Parse Tokens into ParsedInputTypes

- Status: IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

The successful results from `crate::lexer::Lexer.tokenize()` should be passed to `crate::parser::parse_tokens()`.

Returns an `Rc<Environment>`, where the environment represents the global environment. Each token is parsed and hierarchized into an abstract syntax tree representing the layers of environments within each other.

Errors if parsing fails:
-  Numbers lexed as such will error if they cannot be converted into `f64` or `isize` (for floats and integers, respectively)
-  Strings lexed as such error if the lexer somehow produced an invalid string literal token, or if there is no token to process
-  Booleans lexed as such error if the lexer somehow produced anything else than 'true' or 'false', if it produced something else than a boolean, or if there is no token to process

All errors are wrapped in the custom `ParserError` type, which implements descriptive error messages including line numbers (interpreted from new-line characters in the source file) and error contexts.
