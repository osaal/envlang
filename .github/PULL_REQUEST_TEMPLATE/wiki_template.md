# Wiki update

Which sections of the wiki have been changed, and why?

Please make sure that the following things are in order:

[ ] Any external elements, resources, or links have been guaranteed to be valid and correct. Whenever possible, links are robust and long-lived (e.g., identifier links such as DOI's or URN's, links to archived versions of sites).
[ ] The language of the modifications is to your abilities and knowledge correct, and preferably follows British English spelling. Language does not need to be perfect, just understandable and clear for an international audience.
[ ] Claims about the functionalities of Envlang and its interpreter have been validated against the up-to-date source code. **Do not rely on external resources regarding Envlang**, but instead point to the source repository as the source of truth.
